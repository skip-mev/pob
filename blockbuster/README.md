# BlockBuster


> üìï BlockBuster is an app-side mempool + set of proposal handlers that allows 
developers to configure module lanes of transactions in their blocks with 
distinct validation/ordering logic. **The ultimate highway system for 
transactions.** 

## High Level Overview

**`BlockBuster`** is a framework for creating modular, application specific 
mempools by **separating transactions into ‚Äúlanes‚Äù with custom transaction handling.**

You can think of BlockBuster as a **transaction highway system**, where each 
lane on the highway serves a specific purpose and has its own set of rules and 
traffic flow.

Similarly, **BlockBuster** redefines block-space into **`lanes`** - where each 
`lane` has its own set of rules and transaction flow management systems.

* A lane is what we might traditionally consider to be a standard mempool 
where transaction ***validation***, ***ordering*** and ***prioritization*** for 
contained transactions are shared.
* Lanes implement a **standard interface** that allows each individual lane to 
propose and validate a portion of the block
* Lanes are ordered with each other, configurable by developers. All lanes 
together define the desired block structure of a chain.

## BlockBuster Use Cases

A mempool with separate `lanes` can be used for:

1. **MEV mitigation**: a top of block lane could be designed to create an 
in-protocol top-of-block auction (as we are doing with POB) to recapture MEV 
in a transparent and governable way.
2. **Free/reduced fee txs**: transactions with certain properties (e.g. 
from trusted accounts or performing encouraged actions) could leverage a 
free lane to reward behavior.
3. **Dedicated oracle space** Oracles could be included before other kinds 
of transactions to ensure that price updates occur first, and are not able 
to be sandwiched or manipulated.
4. **Orderflow auctions**: an OFA lane could be constructed such that order 
flow providers can have their submitted transactions bundled with specific
backrunners, to guarantee MEV rewards are attributed back to users. 
Imagine MEV-share but in protocol.
5. **Enhanced and customizable privacy**: privacy-enhancing features could 
be introduced, such as threshold encrypted lanes, to protect user data and
 maintain privacy for specific use cases. 
6. **Fee market improvements**: one or many fee markets - such as EIP-1559 - 
could be easily adopted for different lanes (potentially custom for certain 
dApps). Each smart contract/exchange could have its own fee market or auction 
for transaction ordering.
7. **Congestion management**: segmentation of transactions to lanes can help 
mitigate network congestion by capping usage of certain applications and 
tailoring fee markets.

## BlockBuster Design

BlockBuster is a mempool composed of sub-mempools called **lanes**. All 
lanes together define the transaction highway system and BlockBuster mempool. 
When instantiating the BlockBuster mempool, developers will define all of the 
desired lanes and their configurations (including lane ordering). 

Utilizing blockbuster is a simple three step process:

1. Determine the lanes desired. Currently, POB supports three different 
implementations of lanes: top of block lane, free lane, and a default lane.
    1. Top of block lane allows the top of every block to be auctioned off 
    and constructed using logic defined by the `x/builder` module. 
    2. Free lane allows base app to not charge certain types of transactions 
    any fees. For example, delegations and/or re-delegations might be charged no
    fees. What qualifies as a free transaction is determined
     [here](https://github.com/skip-mev/pob/blob/main/blockbuster/lanes/free/factory.go).
    3. Default lane accepts all other transactions and is considered to be 
    analogous to how mempools and proposals are constructed today.
2. Instantiate the mempool in base app. 

```go
mempool := blockbuster.NewMempool(lanes...)
app.App.SetMempool(mempool)
```

1. Instantiate the BlockBuster proposal handlers in base app.

```go
proposalHandlers := abci.NewProposalHandler(
	app.Logger(),
	app.txConfig.TxDecoder(),
	mempool, // BlockBuster mempool
)
app.App.SetPrepareProposal(proposalHandlers.PrepareProposalHandler())
app.App.SetProcessProposal(proposalHandlers.ProcessProposalHandler())
```

***Note: BlockBuster should configure a `DefaultLane` that accepts transactions 
that do not belong to any other lane.***

Transactions are inserted into the first lane that the transaction matches to. 
This means that a given transaction should really only belong to one lane 
(but this isn‚Äôt enforced). 

### Proposals

The ordering of lanes when initializing BlockBuster in base app will determine 
the ordering of how proposals are built. For example, say that we instantiate 
three lanes:

1. Top of block lane
2. Free lane
3. Default lane

**************************************Preparing Proposals**************************************

When the current proposer starts building a block, it will first populate the 
proposal with transactions from the top of block lane, followed by free and 
default lane. Each lane proposes its own set of transactions using the lane‚Äôs 
`PrepareLane` (analogous to `PrepareProposal`). Each lane has a limit on the 
relative percentage of total block space that the lane can consume. 
For example, the free lane might be configured to only make up 10% of any 
block. This is defined on each lane‚Äôs `Config` when it is instantiated. 

In the case when any lane fails to propose its portion of the block, it will 
be skipped and the next lane in the set of lanes will propose its portion of 
the block. Failures of partial block proposals are independent of one another. 

****************************************Processing Proposals****************************************

Block proposals are validated iteratively following the exact ordering of lanes 
defined on base app. Transactions included in block proposals must respect the 
ordering of lanes. Any proposal that includes transactions that are out of 
order relative to the ordering of lanes will be rejected. Following the 
example defined above, if a proposal contains the following transactions:

1. Default transaction (belonging to the default lane)
2. Top of block transaction (belonging to the top of block lane)
3. Free transaction (belonging to the free lane)

It will be rejected because it does not respect the lane ordering.

The BlockBuster `ProcessProposalHandler` processes the proposal by verifying 
all transactions in the proposal according to each lane's verification logic 
in a greedy fashion. If a lane's portion of the proposal is invalid, we 
reject the proposal. After a lane's portion of the proposal is verified, we 
pass the remaining transactions to the next lane in the chain.

**********************Coming Soon**********************

BlockBuster will have its own dedicated gRPC service for searchers, wallets, 
and users that allows them to query what lane their transaction might belong 
in, what fees they might have to pay for a given transaction, and the general 
state of the BlockBuster mempool.

### Lanes

Each lane will define its own:

1. Unique prioritization/ordering mechanism i.e. how will transactions from a 
given lane be ordered in a block / mempool.
2. Inclusion function to determine what types of transactions belong in the lane.
3. Unique block building/verification mechanism.

The general interface that each lane must implement can be found [here](https://github.com/skip-mev/pob/blob/main/blockbuster/lane.go):

```go
// Lane defines an interface used for block construction
	Lane interface {
		sdkmempool.Mempool

		// Name returns the name of the lane.
		Name() string

		// Match determines if a transaction belongs to this lane.
		Match(tx sdk.Tx) bool

		// VerifyTx verifies the transaction belonging to this lane.
		VerifyTx(ctx sdk.Context, tx sdk.Tx) error

		// Contains returns true if the mempool contains the given transaction.
		Contains(tx sdk.Tx) (bool, error)

		// PrepareLane builds a portion of the block. It inputs the maxTxBytes that 
        // can be included in the proposal for the given lane, the partial 
        // proposal, and a function to call the next lane in the chain. The 
        // next lane in the chain will be called with the updated proposal and context.
		PrepareLane(
            ctx sdk.Context, 
            proposal BlockProposal, 
            maxTxBytes int64, 
            next PrepareLanesHandler,
        ) (BlockProposal, error)

		// ProcessLaneBasic validates that transactions belonging to this lane are 
        // not misplaced in the block proposal.
		ProcessLaneBasic(txs []sdk.Tx) error

		// ProcessLane verifies this lane's portion of a proposed block. It inputs 
        // the transactions that may belong to this lane and a function to call 
        // the next lane in the chain. The next lane in the chain will be
        // called with the updated context and filtered down transactions.
		ProcessLane(
            ctx sdk.Context, 
            proposalTxs []sdk.Tx, 
            next ProcessLanesHandler,
        ) (sdk.Context, error)

		// SetAnteHandler sets the lane's antehandler.
		SetAnteHandler(antehander sdk.AnteHandler)

		// Logger returns the lane's logger.
		Logger() log.Logger

		// GetMaxBlockSpace returns the max block space for the lane as a relative percentage.
		GetMaxBlockSpace() sdk.Dec
	}
```

### 1. Intra-lane Transaction Ordering

**Note: Lanes must implement the `sdk.Mempool` interface.**

Transactions within a lane are ordered in a proposal respecting the ordering 
defined on the lane‚Äôs mempool. Developers can define their own custom ordering 
by implementing a custom `TxPriority` struct that allows the lane‚Äôs mempool to 
determine the priority of a transaction `GetTxPriority` and relatively order 
two transactions given the priority `Compare`. The top of block lane includes 
an custom `TxPriority` that orders transactions in the mempool based on their 
bid. 

```go
func TxPriority(config Factory) blockbuster.TxPriority[string] {
    return blockbuster.TxPriority[string]{
        GetTxPriority: func(goCtx context.Context, tx sdk.Tx) string {
            bidInfo, err := config.GetAuctionBidInfo(tx)
            if err != nil {
                panic(err)
            }

            return bidInfo.Bid.String()
        },
        Compare: func(a, b string) int {
            aCoins, _ := sdk.ParseCoinsNormalized(a)
            bCoins, _ := sdk.ParseCoinsNormalized(b)

            switch {
            case aCoins == nil && bCoins == nil:
                return 0

            case aCoins == nil:
                return -1

            case bCoins == nil:
                return 1

            default:
                switch {
                case aCoins.IsAllGT(bCoins):
                        return 1

                case aCoins.IsAllLT(bCoins):
                        return -1

                default:
                        return 0
                }
            }
        },
        MinValue: "",
    }
}

// NewMempool returns a new auction mempool.
func NewMempool(txEncoder sdk.TxEncoder, maxTx int, config Factory) *TOBMempool {
	return &TOBMempool{
		index: blockbuster.NewPriorityMempool(
			blockbuster.PriorityNonceMempoolConfig[string]{
				TxPriority: TxPriority(config),
				MaxTx:      maxTx,
			},
		),
		txEncoder: txEncoder,
		txIndex:   make(map[string]struct{}),
		Factory:   config,
	}
}
```

### 2. [Optional] Transaction Information Retrieval

Each lane can define a factory that configures the necessary set of interfaces 
required for transaction processing, ordering, and validation. Lanes are 
designed such that any given chain can adopt upstream `POB` lanes as long as 
developers implement the specified interface(s) associated with transaction 
information retrieval for that lane.

***A standard cosmos chain or EVM chain can then implement their own versions 
of these interfaces and automatically utilize the lane with no changes upstream!***

For example, the free lane defines an `Factory` that includes a single 
`IsFreeTx` function that allows developers to configure what is a free 
transaction. The default implementation categorizes free transactions as any 
transaction that includes a delegate type message.

```go
// IsFreeTx defines a default function that checks if a transaction is free. In 
// this case, any transaction that is a delegation/redelegation transaction is free.
func (config *DefaultFreeFactory) IsFreeTx(tx sdk.Tx) bool {
	for _, msg := range tx.GetMsgs() {
		switch msg.(type) {
		case *types.MsgDelegate:
			return true
		case *types.MsgBeginRedelegate:
			return true
		case *types.MsgCancelUnbondingDelegation:
			return true
		}
	}

	return false
}
```

### 3. Lane Inclusion Functionality

Lanes must implement a `Match` interface which determines whether a transaction 
should be considered for a given lane. Developer‚Äôs are encouraged to utilize the
 same interfaces defined in the `Factory` to match transactions to lanes. For 
 example, developers might configure a top of block auction lane to accept 
 transactions if they contain a single `MsgAuctionBid` message in the transaction.

### 4.1. [Optional] Transaction Validation

Transactions will be verified the lane‚Äôs `VerifyTx` function. This logic can be 
completely arbitrary. For example, the default lane verifies transactions
using base app‚Äôs `AnteHandler` while the top of block lane verifies transactions
by extracting all bundled transactions included in the bid transaction and then 
verifying the transaction iteratively given the bundle.

### 4.2. Block Building/Verification Logic

Each lane will implement block building and verification logic - analogous to 
`Prepare` and `Process` proposal - that is unique to itself.

* `PrepareLane` will be in charge of building a partial block given the 
transactions in the lane.
* `ProcessLaneBasic` ensures that transactions that should be included in the 
current lane are not interleaved with other lanes i.e. transactions in 
proposals are ordered respecting the ordering of lanes.
* `ProcessLane` will be in charge of verifying the lane‚Äôs partial block.

### Inheritance

Lanes can inherit the underlying implementation of other lanes and overwrite 
any part of the implementation with their own custom functionality. We 
recommend that user‚Äôs extend the functionality of the `Base` lane when first 
exploring the code base.
