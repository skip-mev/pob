Skip Protocol's Protocol-Owned Builder (POB) is a set of Cosmos SDK and ABCI++
primitives that provide application developers the ability to define how their
apps construct and validate blocks on-chain in a transparent, enforceable way,
such as giving complete control to the protocol to recapture, control, and
redistribute MEV.

Skip's POB provides developers with a set of a few core primitives:

* `x/builder`: This Cosmos SDK module gives applications the ability to process
  MEV bundled transactions in addition to having the ability to define how searchers
  and block proposers are rewarded. In addition, the module defines a `AuctionDecorator`,
  which is an AnteHandler decorator that enforces various chain configurable MEV
  rules.
* `ProposalHandler`: This ABCI++ handler defines `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal`
  methods that give applications the ability to perform top-of-block auctions,
  which enables recapturing, redistributing and control over MEV. These methods
  are responsible for block proposal construction and validation.
* `AuctionMempool`: An MEV-aware mempool that enables searchers to submit bundled
  transactions to the mempool and have them bundled into blocks via a top-of-block
  auction. Searchers include a bid in their bundled transactions and the highest
  bid wins the auction. Application devs have control over levers that control
  aspects such as the bid floor and minimum bid increment.

## Releases

### Release Compatibility Matrix

| POB Version | Cosmos SDK |
| :---------: | :--------: |
|   v1.x.x    |  v0.47.x   |

## Install

```shell
$ go install github.com/skip-mev/pob
```

## Setup

1. Import the necessary dependencies into your application. This includes the
   proposal handlers, mempool, keeper, builder types, and builder module. This
   tutorial will go into more detail into each of the dependencies.

   ```go
   import (
     proposalhandler "github.com/skip-mev/pob/abci"
     "github.com/skip-mev/pob/mempool"
     "github.com/skip-mev/pob/x/builder"
     builderkeeper "github.com/skip-mev/pob/x/builder/keeper"
     buildertypes "github.com/skip-mev/pob/x/builder/types"
     ...
   )
   ```

2. Add your module to the the `AppModuleBasic` manager. This manager is in
   charge of setting up basic, non-dependent module elements such as codec
   registration and genesis verification. This will register the special
   `MsgAuctionBid` message. When users want to bid for top of block execution,
   they will submit a transaction - which we call an auction transaction - that
   includes a single `MsgAuctionBid`. We prevent any other messages from being
   included in auction transaction to prevent malicious behavior - such as front
   running or sandwiching.

   ```go
   var (
     ModuleBasics = module.NewBasicManager(
       ...
       builder.AppModuleBasic{},
     )
     ...
   )
   ```

3. The builder `Keeper` is POB's gateway to processing special `MsgAuctionBid`
   messages that allow users to participate in the top of block auction, distribute
   revenue to the auction house, and ensure the validity of auction transactions.

   a. First add the keeper to the app's struct definition.

      ```go
      type App struct {
        ...
        // BuilderKeeper is the keeper that handles processing auction transactions
        BuilderKeeper         builderkeeper.Keeper

        // Custom checkTx handler
        checkTxHandler abci.CheckTx
      }
      ```

    b. Add the builder module to the list of module account permissions. This will
    instantiate the builder module account on genesis.

      ```go
      maccPerms = map[string][]string{
        builder.ModuleName: nil,
        ...
      }
      ```

    c. Instantiate the builder keeper, store keys, and module manager. Note, be
    sure to do this after all the required keeper dependencies have been instantiated.

      ```go
      keys := storetypes.NewKVStoreKeys(
        buildertypes.StoreKey,
        ...
      )

      ...
      app.BuilderKeeper := builderkeeper.NewKeeper(
        appCodec,
        keys[buildertypes.StoreKey],
        app.AccountKeeper,
        app.BankKeeper,
        app.DistrKeeper,
        app.StakingKeeper,
        authtypes.NewModuleAddress(govv1.ModuleName).String(),
      )

      
      app.ModuleManager = module.NewManager(
        builder.NewAppModule(appCodec, app.BuilderKeeper),
        ...
      )
      ```

    d. Searchers bid to have their bundles executed at the top of the block
    using `MsgAuctionBid` messages (by default). While the builder `Keeper` is capable of
    tracking valid bids, it is unable to correctly sequence the auction
    transactions alongside the normal transactions without having access to the
    application’s mempool. As such, we have to instantiate POB’s custom
    `AuctionMempool` - a modified version of the SDK’s priority sender-nonce
    mempool - into the application. Note, this should be done after `BaseApp` is
    instantiated.

    d.1. Application developers can choose to implement their own `AuctionFactory` implementation
    or use the default implementation provided by POB. The `AuctionFactory` is responsible
    for determining what is an auction bid transaction and how to extract the bid information
    from the transaction. The default implementation provided by POB is `DefaultAuctionFactory`
    which uses the `MsgAuctionBid` message to determine if a transaction is an auction bid
    transaction and extracts the bid information from the message. 

    ```go
    config := mempool.NewDefaultAuctionFactory(txDecoder)

    mempool := mempool.NewAuctionMempool(txDecoder, txEncoder, maxTx, config)
    bApp.SetMempool(mempool)
    ```

    e. With Cosmos SDK version 0.47.0, the process of building blocks has been
    updated and moved from the consensus layer, CometBFT, to the application layer.
    When a new block is requested, the proposer for that height will utilize the
    `PrepareProposal` handler to build a block while the `ProcessProposal` handler
    will verify the contents of the block proposal by all validators. The
    combination of the `AuctionMempool`, `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal`
    handlers allows the application to verifiably build valid blocks with
    top-of-block block space reserved for auctions. Additionally, we override the 
    `BaseApp`'s `CheckTx` handler with our own custom `CheckTx` handler that will 
    be responsible for checking the validity of transactions. We override the
    `CheckTx` handler so that we can verify auction transactions before they are
    inserted into the mempool. With the POB `CheckTx`, we can verify the auction
    transaction and all of the bundled transactions before inserting the auction
    transaction into the mempool. This is important because we otherwise there may be
    discrepencies between the auction transaction and the bundled transactions
    are validated in `CheckTx` and `PrepareProposal` such that the auction can be 
    griefed. All other transactions will be executed with base app's `CheckTx`.

    ```go
    // Create the entire chain of AnteDecorators for the application.
    anteDecorators := []sdk.AnteDecorator{
      auction.NewAuctionDecorator(
        app.BuilderKeeper,
        txConfig.TxEncoder(),
        mempool,
      ),
      ...,
    }

    // Create the antehandler that will be used to check transactions throughout the lifecycle
    // of the application.
    anteHandler := sdk.ChainAnteDecorators(anteDecorators...)
    app.SetAnteHandler(anteHandler)

    // Create the proposal handler that will be used to build and validate blocks.
    handler := proposalhandler.NewProposalHandler(
      mempool, 
      bApp.Logger(), 
      anteHandler,
      txConfig.TxEncoder(),
      txConfig.TxDecoder(),
    )
    app.SetPrepareProposal(handler.PrepareProposalHandler())
    app.SetProcessProposal(handler.ProcessProposalHandler())

    // Set the custom CheckTx handler on BaseApp.
    checkTxHandler := pobabci.CheckTxHandler(
      app.App,
      app.TxDecoder,
      mempool,
      anteHandler,
      chainID,
    )
    app.SetCheckTx(checkTxHandler)

    ...

    // CheckTx will check the transaction with the provided checkTxHandler. We override the default
    // handler so that we can verify bid transactions before they are inserted into the mempool.
    // With the POB CheckTx, we can verify the bid transaction and all of the bundled transactions
    // before inserting the bid transaction into the mempool.
    func (app *TestApp) CheckTx(req cometabci.RequestCheckTx) cometabci.ResponseCheckTx {
      return app.checkTxHandler(req)
    }

    // SetCheckTx sets the checkTxHandler for the app.
    func (app *TestApp) SetCheckTx(handler abci.CheckTx) {
      app.checkTxHandler = handler
    }
    ```

    f. Finally, update the app's `InitGenesis` order and ante-handler chain.

    ```go
    genesisModuleOrder := []string{
      buildertypes.ModuleName,
      ...,
    }
    ```

## Params

Note, before building or upgrading the application, make sure to initialize the
escrow address for POB in the parameters of the module. The default parameters
initialize the escrow address to be the module account address. The escrow address 
will be the address that is receiving a portion of auction house revenue alongside the proposer (or custom rewards providers).
